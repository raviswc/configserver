# configserver
A Configuration Server that to store retrieve configurations that could be overridden at user-group/user and other levels. Many organizations tend to develop user front-ends that pull together capabilities developed by multiple teams. Such user front-ends will require access to configurations relevant to various components from these teams to be able to build the UI, connect to the server etc. Some aspects of these components, especially visual aspects such as columns that are visible in a grid, column order etc., would be customizable for one or more user-groups and/or individual users. As organizations support multiple devices/browsers, some of these configurations need to be be overridden for specific device/browser combinations. These configurations could again be customized for specific user-groups/users. Finally, some aspects of configurations would be environment specific. For global organizations, production environments may dependent on where the user is located for performance reasons. This service will aspire to support these as it evolves.
